# Is it a sure bet? #
#### A sure bet is when you are guaranteed to earn money whichever outcome happens. You only have to place fractions of your total bet on each result accordingly. Of course, one bet provider would never provide a sure bet, then they lose money, but several bet providers might have different odds enabling you to cherry-pick odds. Ever wondered about that? Well you and me both! ####
###### Example: consider a match with only two possible outcomes, e.g. a finale. Person1, the underdog with high odds (i.e. low probability of winning) is competing against Person2, the favorite. Betting provider A provides the odds [4, 1.2]. Betting provider B provides the odds [3.14, 1.4]. A and B both favor P2 as the winner. 4 in odds on P1 at A, and 1.4 in odds on P2 at B seams like a good deal. It turns out you are guaranteed to earn 3.57% on you initial bet if you place 25.93% on P1 at A and 74.07% on P2 at B ######
Converting an odds to probability is just inverting it. I.e. probability = 1/odds. So 4 in odds means that the betting provider thinks it's a 25% chance that this outcome occurs. Summing up the probability from A and B yields, 108% and 103%, respectively. Everything above 100% is free money for the betting providers. With cherry-picking that number becomes 96%. If it is less than 100% you as the better are guaranteed to earn money.

Happy searching
