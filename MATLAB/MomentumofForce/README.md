# Momentum of Force #
#### I have built the Mailbox Stand in the street for houses 3-7 in my street. And now after some winters with frost heaving its becomes skew. And the neighbors complain about it esthetics. So I bought wire and my plan was to straiten it up with momentum. And that made me think. Should I fasten the wire high? That would give the momentum a large arm, but the perpendicular decomposed force would be small, most of it would be a parallel force. Or should I maximize the perpendicular force and fasten the wire low, i.e. small arm. To make matters even more complicated the setup is not a right triangle. Ever wondered about that? Well you and me both! ####
###### Below I have added a sketch of the problem. The wire has to be fastened to a sloping ground lower than the foot of the Mailbox Stand. I cannot just apply Pythagoras. I needed both the law of cosine and sine to create an expression of momentum that only depended on the angle of the wire. ######

Let me explain my sketch:
alpha: that is my one variable of equation<br />
h &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; : That is the height I want to determine<br />
s &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; : the length along the slope to where I will fasten the wire to the ground. ~1-2m<br />
M &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; : That is the momentum I want to maximize by choosing the ideal alpha<br />
F &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; : Tensile of the wire<br />
w &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; : length of the wire<br />
gamma: The angle of my slope is 24 degrees<br />

After applying both the law of cosine and sine this is the expression for M:

And I want to maximize M. Of course I could derivative it and set it to 0. But it is much more fun to plot it in MATLAB and see the curve.

See for yourself. Enjoy!
