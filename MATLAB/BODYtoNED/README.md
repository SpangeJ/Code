# Rotate a coordinate system from BODY to North East Down #
##### Imagine there is a boat at open sea. It has a direction of speed (or yaw). Waves might cause it to roll at an angle, and pitch at another. What is its compass direction? Ever wondered about that? Well you and me both! #####
###### The math here is no easy-peasy but you must transform your local body-coordinates to the global NED-coordinates by applying your roll, pitch, and yaw to a rotation matrix ;) ######
