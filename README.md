### Git Large File Storage (LFS) ###
###### Git Large File Storage (LFS) replaces large files such as audio samples, videos, datasets, and graphics with text pointers inside Git, while storing the file contents on a remote server. If Git treats the the file as a binary file you won't see your changes, then I prefer to add it to LFS ######
* .slx
* .slxc
* .mat
* .png
* .pdf
* .jpg
