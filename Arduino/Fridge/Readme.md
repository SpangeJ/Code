# Peltier Fridge
 This Code is for controlling the temperature inside an isolated box (Fridge) with peltier elements and heat conductors on the outside.
The Fridge has 4 compartments, each with its individual temperatur sensor and peltier element.
The goal is to store wine & vegetables and mature cheese.
It is not a goal to reach refigirator temperatures of 4C, but 10C is a goal!
